# Overview

I hope to be able to continue deeveloping this and making it more unique, and hopefully learn how to fully integrate a database into it.

I wrote this software to be able to use during dungeons and dragons if I do not have my dice with me.

# Web Pages

The First web Page is a dice roller, The user can decide how many dice to roll and how many sides they have.
The Second web Page is Rock Paper Scissors, and the Program randomly picks an action.
The Third web page is for future development and currently contains a button that does nothing.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to complete this project.

The languages used were Python, HTML, and Javascript.
